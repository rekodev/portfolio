# Portfolio by rekodev

Welcome to my personal portfolio project showcasing six of my major projects. One of these includes a real-world business application for Antiaging School, which I built from front to back and launched on a VPS server.

You can view the live portfolio at [this link](https://portfolio-rekodev.vercel.app/).

## Project Overview

This portfolio was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) (specifically, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The website is divided into several sections:

- **Main:** An introduction and brief overview of the portfolio.
- **About Me:** Personal information about me and my journey in the tech industry.
- **Skills:** A showcase of my technical skills and competencies.
- **Portfolio:** Displays the six projects I've worked on. Each project card has one or two buttons for accessing the project live or its GitHub repository.

Please note, the Antiaging School project does not have a GitHub repository as its code is private, and the "Baigiamasis Projektas" does not have a live version as I haven't deployed the backend.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rekodev/portfolio.git
```

Navigate into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd portfolio
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
